# Jacob's Portfolio

## Description

This is my work for Challenge 2 for the UCF coding bootcamp. It is a portfolio showing off my works completed so far in class, and a brief bio of my skills.  Being directly in the path of hurricane Ian has prevented me from focusing on this project as much as I would have liked.  However, working on this project has allowed me to see the areas in which I currently struggle; mainly being a lack of practice.  I have learned a lot working on this, and I am confident that with practice I will become a great programmer.
